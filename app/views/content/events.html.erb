        <div class="large-6 columns">

          <p>After a grueling series of online matches, the 40 teams registered into the tournament were cut down into a remaining 8 through a succession of round robin matches. On the day of the live event, the finalists that made it through the group stages met up in the Student Union to duke it out for first place in ESI’s second League of Legends Tournament. Many great matches were played throughout the day, having been streamed to a big screen for friends and fans in a viewing room. As per usual, attendees at the live event took part in a free raffle giveaway for a variety of Riot swag, including but not limited to Soraka Bananas and Teemo Hats.

      <p>However, at the end of the day, only one team can claim the title of champion. We would like to congratulate the team Kony 2012 for managing to do just that, having unexpectedly turned the tables on all odds and won all matches the finals despite being one of the lower seeds. They have each walked away with an extra 20$ in RP in their in-game pockets, in addition to the shiny exclusive skin only available to winners of tournaments – Triumphant Ryze.</p>

         <h3>OSI Charity Gaming III</h3>
      <h6>October 22nd, 2011</h6>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="large-6 columns">
          <p>The third and final event from OSI, before transforming into ESI, was held on October 22, 2011.  This event was focused on Brawl and Melee with a side event for Smash 64.  With over 68 unique entrants between the three games and six brackets, OSI raised over $800 for charitable causes.  The three most impressive stats were the 33 entrants from Brawl singles, 30 from Melee singles, and an impressive 16 entrants for Smash 64 doubles, a game which at the time was 12 years old.  This momentum carried OSI through its transition into ESI, which consisted of hosting many variations of events and tournaments in order to raise charitable funds for noble causes.         </p>
